## [JAVA] CompletableFuture

CompletableFuture is very import and useful in my work, let's see how it works.

First of all, why we need a Future: to know the status of a thread, whether it's completed or failed etc

Future:
- Interface which represents the result of the async task
- it allows you to check
  - computation  is completed
  - get the result
  - take care of exception
